<h2>I.</h2>

<p>Mr. Lee had a gardener
whose name was Long. He
lived in a little cottage near
the great house of his employer.
He was a very good
gardener, and Mr. Lee valued
him highly for his knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
of plants, and for the fidelity
with which the man served
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Long had a family, but
only three of his children remained
at home. The others
worked in the mills, or had
places in the city. Mary, the
youngest, was about Flora
Lee’s age; and the other two
at home were fourteen and
sixteen.</p>

<p>Early in the winter Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Long was taken sick, and for
several weeks was confined to
her bed. During this illness
Susan took care of her mother,
and did the house work
besides, with the help of her
father and her brother John.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee thought this was
too much for a girl of sixteen,
and she wanted to send
one of her servants down to
the cottage to do the hardest
of the work; but Susan declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
she could do the whole
very well indeed, and did not
need any help.</p>

<p>At the same time she said
that Mary gave her some trouble,
and was a great care to
her. Mrs. Lee, finding she
could do no more, offered to
take the troublesome little
girl home with her, and keep
her for two or three weeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee did this kind act
in a very quiet and pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
way. She did not tell Susan
she would take her sister in
order to make less work in
the family, for she saw that
she took pride in doing it all
herself. But she invited Mary
to go up to her house and
spend two or three weeks
with Flora.</p>

<p>I do not think it is wicked
to do a kind act in this way,
for it can hardly be called deception.
Some people do their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
good deeds so that every body
may see them; and some do
all their kind acts so that no
person’s feelings shall be hurt.</p>

<p>The New Testament tells us
not to let the right hand know
what the left hand doeth; that
is, we must not parade our
deeds of charity and kindness
before the world. If you had
a little friend who was very
poor, but very proud, you
might do something for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
in such a way that he would
not feel as though he was accepting
a gift.</p>

<p>Susan was very glad of this
relief, and Mary was very glad
to go up to the great house,
and walk through its handsome
rooms, and over its rich
carpets. For the first day she
could do nothing but walk
through the rooms and look
at the fine things she saw.
There were a great many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
books with pretty pictures in
them. The walls of the parlor
and sitting room were covered
over with fine paintings,
and on the mantel-pieces were
beautiful statues. There were,
indeed, so many nice things to
be seen, that one day was
scarcely enough to allow her
to look at them as much as
she wished.</p>

<p>But my story is not about
fine pictures, and statues, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
carpets, and sofas. It will be
a story within a story which
Mr. Lee told to the children,
with the reason why he told
it; and I hope my young
friends will learn the same
good lesson from it that poor
Mary Long learned.</p>

<p>When Mary had been at
Mr. Lee’s a few days, and got
used to the fine things there,
Flora missed a little gold
thimble, which one of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
aunts had given her as a
Christmas present.</p>

<p>Flora felt very badly when
she found that the thimble
was gone; not because it was
gold, and worth two or three
dollars, but because it was the
gift of her aunt.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Flora,” said
Mrs. Lee. “You will probably
find the thimble again.
If you do not, crying will not
mend the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“But aunt Sarah gave it to
me, and I wouldn’t lose it for
any thing,” sobbed Flora.</p>

<p>“Where did you leave it,
my child?”</p>

<p>“On the table in the parlor.
I put it there while I
opened the blind; and when
I came out I forgot all about
it. Then I went to look for
it, and couldn’t find it any
where.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
left it there? Think again
for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Very sure, mother.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure, Flora,”
added her mother, with a
smile. “You know you were
very positive, the other day,
that you left your scissors in
the basket; and then you
found them in your play
room—just where you had
put them yourself.”</p>

<p>“I know it, mother; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
feel pretty sure, this time, that
I left the thimble on the table.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better
look in every room you have
visited since you lost it. How
long ago was it?”</p>

<p>“About an hour, I should
think. I never thought of it
till just now.”</p>

<p>“Well, you look in every
place you have been, and if
you don’t succeed in finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
it, I will help you search for
it then.”</p>

<p>Flora went immediately to
the play room, and then to
the kitchen, the dining room,
and a dozen other places; but
the gold thimble was not to
be found. Then she tried to
think where else she had been,
and went over the ground a
second time.</p>

<p>“I can’t find it, mother. I
have looked every where,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
she, as she joined her mother
in the sitting room.</p>

<p>“It must be in the house
somewhere. It cannot have
been stolen. None of the servants
have been in the parlor;
and if they had, I am
sure they would not steal any
thing that belongs to you,
Flora.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think any one stole
it, mother. How wicked that
would be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Have you seen the thimble,
Mary?” said Mrs. Lee,
as she turned to the gardener’s
daughter.</p>

<p>“No, marm. I haven’t seen
any thing of it, as true as
I live and breathe,” replied
Mary, speaking in a very earnest
manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee looked at her when
she used these strong words,
and she was sad, for there was
something in Mary’s manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
that did not seem to her just
right. But she said no more,
and went immediately with
Flora to search again for the
lost thimble.</p>

<p>If Mary had answered with
a simple “No,” perhaps Mrs.
Lee would not have suspected
her; as it was, she could not
help thinking that the child
had taken the thimble. Jesus
said, “Let your communications
be, Yea, yea; nay, nay;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
for whatsoever is more than
these cometh of evil.”</p>

<p>Those words, “as true as I
live and breathe,” children,
came of evil.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>
</div>

<p>The search for the gold
thimble was long and patient,
but it could not be found;
and when Mrs. Lee said it
was useless to look any more,
poor Flora burst into tears
again.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what has become
of it, mother,” said she.
“I am so sorry I took it out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of the work box! Aunt Sarah
will think I am careless.”</p>

<p>“Why did you take it out?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to show it to
Mary. It was so pretty, I
thought it would please her.”</p>

<p>“I do not see that any one
is to be blamed,” added her
father.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame any one but
myself. I was careless to
carry it around the house
with me. I remember when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
I went to open the blind, I
was afraid I should scratch
it, and so I put it on the
table.”</p>

<p>“I will buy you another,
Flora, the next time I go to
Boston,” said Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“But that wouldn’t be aunt
Sarah’s thimble,” sobbed Flora.</p>

<p>“Perhaps aunt Sarah will
give you another when she
hears that you have lost it.”</p>

<p>“I would rather find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“When you can’t do what
you would, you must do the
next best thing, my child.”</p>

<p>“What is that, father?”</p>

<p>“Do without it.”</p>

<p>The tea bell rang then, and
Flora wiped away her tears,
and tried to reconcile herself
to the loss of the thimble.
She was very sad and unhappy,
for she felt that it had
been lost by her own carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The feeling that we have
done wrong is far more painful
than the consequences which
follow that wrong. Many good
and true men have been happy
while their bodies were
burning at the stake, or while
they were shut up in prison.</p>

<p>All the family sat down at
the tea table except Mr. Lee,
and he went up stairs. He
was absent fifteen or twenty
minutes, and when he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
back he looked very sad, as
though something unpleasant
had happened.</p>

<p>But no one asked him any
questions, and he did not say
any thing to inform the rest
of the party what had occurred
during his absence.</p>

<p>After tea, the family gathered
around the cheerful fire
in the sitting room, as they
always did during the long
winter evenings. Mary was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
busy with a great book, which
was full of pictures. Flora
had a little story book in her
hand, but she did not read
it. She felt so badly about
the loss of her thimble that
she could not read.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was sewing, and
Mr. Lee was looking over the
newspaper which David White
had brought in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He did not read all the
time, for he kept looking into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the fire, and seemed to be
thinking of something besides
the contents of the paper.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Flora?”
asked he, at last, as he
laid the newspaper on the table.
“You are very quiet to-night.
You generally laugh
and play at this time in the
evening.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking about
my thimble, father. I would
give any thing to know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
has become of it,” replied she,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mary can tell you
something about it,” added Mr.
Lee, as he fixed his gaze upon
the gardener’s daughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any thing
about it, sir,” replied Mary,
her face turning very red, as
her eyes met the stern look
of Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“Were you with Flora at
the time she lost the thimble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I suppose I was;
but I haven’t got the thimble.”</p>

<p>“I know you haven’t got it,
Mary. I only asked you if
you were with Flora at the
time she lost it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I was, sir; I don’t
know. But I haven’t seen it,
sir; as true as I live and
breathe, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see it on the
table, when Flora left it? Just
think a moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir; I didn’t see any
thing at all of it.”</p>

<p>“There would have been
no harm in seeing it, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; but I didn’t see it.
I hope to die if I did.”</p>

<p>“I would not use such expressions,
Mary. A simple
‘Yes,’ or a ‘No,’ is a great
deal better. It means more.
It sounds more like the truth,
than, ‘As true as I live and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
breathe,’ and, ‘I hope to die
if I did,’ or ‘did not.’”</p>

<p>“I won’t say so any more,
sir. I did not think it was
any harm.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you did not; but
I am always afraid, when a
person uses these strong expressions
to me, that he is
telling me a falsehood.”</p>

<p>“O, I am sure Mary hasn’t
got my thimble, father,” said
Flora, who could not see why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Mr. Lee should be so sad and
stern, and almost accuse poor
Mary of taking the thimble.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I haven’t, Flora.
As true as I—”</p>

<p>“Do not say that again,
Mary,” interrupted Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“But Mary hasn’t got my
thimble, father,” added Flora.</p>

<p>“She has not, my child.
Here is your thimble,” said
Mr. Lee, handing the lost
treasure to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Why, father! Where did
you get it?” exclaimed Flora,
jumping out of her chair, and
dancing with pleasure at the
sight of the thimble.</p>

<p>“I found it, Flora.”</p>

<p>“Where did you find it,
father?”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to tell you
at present.”</p>

<p>“Then I was very careless.
I will try to do better
in future.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Do not reproach yourself,
my child. I do not even know
that you have been careless.
On the contrary, I think you
were very prudent in taking
off the thimble before you
opened the blind.”</p>

<p>“What <em>do</em> you mean, father?
I’m sure I don’t understand
you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will understand
me another time.”</p>

<p>During this conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Mary’s face was very red, and
she kept turning the leaves
of the great book; though
any one might have seen that
she hardly looked at the pictures.
She did not seem to
take any interest in what was
going on in the room, and
expressed no pleasure at the
finding of the thimble.</p>

<p>“I knew Mary hadn’t got
it!” said Flora.</p>

<p>“We will say no more about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
it just now, my child; and I
will tell you a story. It will
be a kind of fairy story, and
I hope it will be pleasing to
you.”</p>

<p>“O, I am so delighted, father!”
said Flora, as she seated
herself on a cricket at his
feet.</p>

<p>“And, Mary, you may put
away your book, now, for I
think the story will interest
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>The gardener’s daughter at
once obeyed, and Mr. Lee commenced
the story, which will
be found in the next chapter.</p>

</div>

<p>“‘Once upon a time—’”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way the
fairy stories begin,” exclaimed
Flora, clapping her hands with
delight.</p>

<p>“Well, my child, you must
not interrupt me, or I shall
not get along very fast. ‘Once
upon a time, there was a young
man whose name was Seekpeace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
His parents had taken
great care in bringing him up,
and stored his mind with good
lessons to guide and protect
him in the hour of temptation.</p>

<p>But the parents of Seekpeace
were poor people, and
could not afford to support
their son in idleness, even if
they had wished to do so.
They had done all they could
for him in teaching him to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
true to God and true to himself.</p>

<p>One day they called Seekpeace
to them, and told him
they could not afford to take
care of him any longer, and
that he must go out into the
world and make his own fortune.
They hoped he would
try to be a wise and good
man; and told him that nothing
but a pure heart could
make him happy either in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
world or in the world to
come.</p>

<p>Seekpeace was a smart,
active young man, and was
very willing to go out into
the world and take care of
himself. So he took a little
bundle of clothes, and with
staff in hand started off on
his journey.</p>

<p>He felt that he was now
his own master; and when he
started, he wanted to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
a great and good man. He
promised himself that he
would be faithful to the principles
which his father and
mother had taught him, and
that they should never have
cause to be ashamed of him.</p>

<p>Seekpeace had not gone far
before he met an old man
who was dressed in coarse
and homely garments. He
seemed to be very poor, but
his face beamed with smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“What is your name?” inquired
Seekpeace.</p>

<p>“My name is Poverty; and
I belong to a very large family
of that name.”</p>

<p>“Where are you travelling?”</p>

<p>“I am going home to the
Valley of Shadows, where I
am to meet all my brethren
of every name and family.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wear better
clothes?” asked Seekpeace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
glancing at his coarse
garments.</p>

<p>“They are the best I have.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you buy better?”</p>

<p>“I have no money.”</p>

<p>“What! an old man like
you with no money? What
have you been doing all your
life?”</p>

<p>“I have been serving the
Master; and perhaps I have
laid up treasures which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
some day be bestowed upon
me.”</p>

<p>“Poor man! How I pity
you!”</p>

<p>“You need not pity me.
I am happy and contented.
I shall soon get home, and
then I shall enter upon the
enjoyment of my treasures.”</p>

<p>“But it is too bad for an
old man like you to be without
money, and to be dressed
in such mean garments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“When I get home I shall
wear brighter garments than
these; and in the Valley of
Shadows, money will not buy
me even a cup of the living
water which alone can slake
my thirst.”</p>

<p>“You are a very queer old
man,” said Seekpeace, as he
glanced at the pilgrim’s face,
upon which played a sweet
smile.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am. My neighbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
call me Contented Poverty;
and I think I am as
happy as any of them,” replied
the old man, as he resumed
his journey.</p>

<p>Seekpeace did not know
what to think of the old man.
He did not see how he could
be so happy, dressed in those
coarse clothes, and with no
money in his purse. He did
not understand who the Master
was that he served, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
why he was not paid for his
work at the time he did it.</p>

<p>He noticed that the old
man did not complain because
he was not paid; and certainly
he was a very happy man
for one who had not received
his wages.</p>

<p>When Seekpeace had gone
a little farther, he saw a fine
carriage drawn by six beautiful
horses, in which was seated
another old man. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
dressed in the richest and
most costly garments.</p>

<p>“Who are you, sir?” asked
Seekpeace, taking off his hat
and bowing low to the old
man.</p>

<p>“My name is Wealth; and
I live in the great mansion
which you see on the hill.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get all
the money to enable you to
purchase these fine horses,
and these very rich garments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and the great house on the
hill?”</p>

<p>“I gave myself up to the
business of money-making.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be a very
happy man,” said Seekpeace,
though there was no smile
on the old man’s face.</p>

<p>“I have servants by the
score, and my house is full of
fine things. My table is covered
with dainties, and my
beds are of the softest down,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
said the man; but he did not
say that he was happy, though
Seekpeace thought he must
be, in the midst of so many
fine things.</p>

<p>The carriage left him, and
Seekpeace could not help comparing
the condition of the
two old men. One had all
the fine things of this world,
and the other had none.</p>

<p>“I will be a rich man,” said
Seekpeace. “I will get money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and buy me a great mansion,
and fine clothes, and handsome
horses. I will have
servants by the score. I will
have my table covered with
the richest food of the land,
and I will sleep upon beds of
down.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, young man,”
said a voice near him. “Be
a rich man, and then all men
will bow their heads to you.”</p>

<p>Seekpeace turned to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
who it was that spoke to him,
and beheld the giant whose
name is Goldenhand standing
by his side. The young man
was not afraid of the giant,
for though he was very large,
there was nothing ugly about
him.</p>

<p>He was dressed in rich
garments, and he was just
the person to please a young
man. He was a very skilful
and powerful giant; and just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to show Seekpeace what he
could do, he pulled down an
old house that stood by the
road side, and piled up a
handsome stone mansion in
its place; and he performed
a great many other wonderful
things, that filled the young
man with unbounded astonishment.</p>

<p>“Now, young man, you
have seen what I can do, and
if you wish to go with me, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
will help you to become rich
and great,” said Goldenhand.</p>

<p>“But where must I go,
and what must I do?” asked
Seekpeace.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you now.
A great many different kinds
of people go with me. Some
of them will do any thing I
ask them to do, and they
generally get rich very fast.
Others are not so willing to
obey me, and prate about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
right and justice; and a great
many of these I am obliged
to discharge from my service.
If you go with me, I shall
expect you to obey me in all
things.”</p>

<p>“I wish to know what I
am to do before I go,” said
Seekpeace. “I am in search
of happiness.”</p>

<p>“Come with me, then, young
man, and you will most certainly
find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t go with him,” said
a sweet voice on the other
side of Seekpeace. “At least
don’t promise to obey him in
all things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>
</div>

<p>Seekpeace turned to see who
had spoken, and beheld a beautiful
little fairy, whose face was
so full of loveliness that he
wanted to make her his friend
at once.</p>

<p>“Who are you, beautiful
fairy?” asked Seekpeace.</p>

<p>“My name is Pureheart,”
replied the fairy. “Goldenhand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
has done a great deal
of good in his time, but he
often leads young men away
from their duty, and makes
them very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind her,” said
Goldenhand. “She is very
pretty, but she can give you
no fine houses, no rich food,
no soft beds, no willing servants.”</p>

<p>“I can give you what is
better than all these; I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
give you a conscience void
of offence before God and
man.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to hear her
prate; but come with me, and
I will show you the Palace of
Luxury, in which you may
live and be happy, if you will
only serve me faithfully, and
not bother your head with
Pureheart’s nonsense,” said
Goldenhand.</p>

<p>“Be wise, Seekpeace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
do not take a step which you
will regret when it is too late
to repent,” urged Pureheart.</p>

<p>Then Seekpeace was sorely
perplexed. Goldenhand promised
him ever so many fine
things; and Pureheart, beautiful
as she was, said nothing
about great houses, soft clothing,
and downy beds.</p>

<p>After thinking a long time,
he told the giant he would
go with him and see the Palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of Luxury. Then he saw
the tears in the eyes of Pureheart,
as she turned to leave
him.</p>

<p>Goldenhand took his arm,
and presently they reached
the Palace of Luxury. The
doors were thrown wide open
to them, and the giant pointed
out the splendid carpets, the
rich furniture, the soft beds,
the tables loaded with all the
good things of every clime,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the spicy gardens, and every
thing that could please the
senses.</p>

<p>“Now will you come with
me?” asked Goldenhand.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“You see that cottage yonder.
In it lives a widow, with
three small children. She has
a hundred pieces of gold in
the house. Go and take it
from her. You shall have it
all for your own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“What! rob the widow
and the orphans of their daily
bread? I cannot do that,”
replied Seekpeace, with evident
horror.</p>

<p>“You are a silly young
man. Why, others do just
such things, and why should
not you?” said Goldenhand,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Others may do it, but I
cannot.”</p>

<p>“Then you and I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
be friends,” added the giant,
angrily; and he disappeared,
leaving Seekpeace standing at
the door of the Palace of
Luxury.</p>

<p>While the young pilgrim
was wondering what had become
of the giant, he perceived
that Pureheart was
again standing by his side.</p>

<p>“You have done well, Seekpeace,”
said the fairy, with a
sweet smile on her beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
face. “But I see you still
cast longing looks at the Palace
of Luxury. Let us enter,
and examine some of the fine
things you saw there.”</p>

<p>Pureheart led the way into
the palace, and the young man
again admired the splendors
of the interior, and wished he
might possess them.</p>

<p>“What a rich carpet!” exclaimed
he.</p>

<p>“It is very pretty, but let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
us examine it a little more
closely.”</p>

<p>Then Pureheart tore up the
rich carpet, and Seekpeace saw
that beneath it there were a
great many little sharp points;
and the fairy told him that by
and by the carpet would wear
down, and the sharp points
would prick the feet of him
who owned the palace, if he
got into it by robbing the
widow and the orphan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Pureheart then led him into
a chamber, and showed him
that beneath the downy bed
there were sharp spikes, which
would pierce the flesh of him
who slept on the couch, if he
entered the palace by such
means as the giant had recommended.</p>

<p>In the dishes of rich food
the fairy pointed out little
grains of poison, as well as
at the bottom of the wine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
cups. The fine clothes in the
wardrobe were found to be
filled with nettles. In the
splendid apartments of the
palace, hid beneath the fine
furniture, they found some
hideous serpents, which no
one could wish to have in
the house with him.</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t want
to live in such a place as
this,” said Seekpeace.</p>

<p>“I thought you would not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
if you only understood its nature.”</p>

<p>“But can’t I have all these
fine things without being wicked?”
asked Seekpeace.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may. I don’t
know. I only wanted to teach
you that all these fine things
are not happiness: Remember
what your father and
mother told you; be true to
God and true to yourself, and
you will be happy, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
you live in a palace or a cottage.”</p>

<p>“You are very beautiful,”
said Seekpeace, as he gazed
at the shining face of the
fairy. “I wish you would go
with me on my journey.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you if you
wish me to do so; but I am
jealous; and when you forget
or neglect me, and love
Goldenhand better than you
love me, I shall leave you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“You shall be my friend
to the end of my journey,”
said Seekpeace, as he embraced
the fairy. “And if
Goldenhand won’t help me
without my lying, and cheating,
and stealing, why, then I
will be like the old man in
the coarse garb, whom I met
this morning. He was no
friend of Goldenhand, I suspect.”</p>

<p>“He was not. The giant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
tempted him as he has tempted
you; but the old man loved
me best.”</p>

<p>“I will love you with all
my soul as long as I live; and
when I meet the old man in
the Valley of Shadows, I hope
we shall be happy.”</p>

<p>“You will be, forever and
forever,” said the fairy, with
a radiant smile.</p>

<p>And Seekpeace most faithfully
kept his promise, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
was happy to the end of his
journey.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Now, how do you like my
story, children?” asked Mr.
Lee.</p>

<p>“Very much, father,” replied
Flora. “I think I know
what it means too. Goldenhand
wasn’t a real giant, like
those in Jack and the Beanstalk.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
What do you think of Pureheart?”</p>

<p>“She was a very nice fairy.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of her,
Mary? Did you like her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I hope you will love
her as Seekpeace did. But,
Mary, you did not say ‘no’ to
the giant when he asked you
to take the thimble, as Goldenhand
asked Seekpeace to take
the widow’s gold. If you had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
said ‘no,’ Pureheart would at
once have come to help you
resist temptation, and make
you happy.”</p>

<p>“I never will do so again,”
exclaimed Mary, bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>“I hope you never will,”
added Mr. Lee. “The giant
often tempts boys and girls
to take what does not belong
to them. Resist him, as Seekpeace
did, and Pureheart will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
be your friend to the end of
your journey.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee did not tell the
children that he had found
the gold thimble in Mary’s
basket; but he hoped that
his story would do her good.
And I hope my little readers
will understand and profit
by it.</p>
